{A}: So, what, now I’m just supposed to do anything that {B} does? I mean, what if they jumped off a cliff?
{C}: If {B} were to jump off a cliff, they would’ve done their due diligence regarding the height of the cliff, the depth of the water, and the angle of entry, so yes. If you see {B} jump off a cliff, by all means, jump off a cliff.
{A}: <i>You</i> jump off a cliff!
{C}: Gladly. Provided {B} did first.
