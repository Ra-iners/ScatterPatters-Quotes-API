*The squad is talking about what it'd be like to open up a homemade Pokemon gym*
{A}, joking: {B}'s just sitting at the end, juggling- fushigi-ing 2 glass balls, in super tight pants, just waiting for their kid delivery once they best their minions.
{B}: Well they would be Pokeballs. And also it's not a kid delivery. There's no fucking guarantee that a kid that comes into the <i>beginning</i> of my crucible makes it to the <i>end</i> of it undefeated.
{B}: In fact, I'm gonna stack this gym! With fuckin pros!
{B}: It's- It's gonna be brutal. It's gonna be a torture gym.
{C}: Well- Well what's the theme? Are you like- is it a bug theme, or like-
{B}: YEAH, {I}. UH- UH- UH- UH YEAH {I}. IM GONNA OPEN UP A <i>BUG TYPE</i> POKEMON GYM. YOU <i><b>IDIOT</i></b>.
{B}: YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WANT, BECAUSE I WANNA GIVE- I WANNA SHIT OUT BADGES FOR EVERY HAM AND EGGER THAT COMES TO MY FRONT DOOR.
{A}: *Cracking up*
{B}: YEAH, {I}. 'Uhh, go Caterpie! >~>' That's me, you FUCKING imbecile. 'Yeah go- uhhh- d-do your best, Kakuna!'
{B}: WHAT ARE YOU FUCKING TALKING ABOU- Yeah a ~bug type~ gym.
{C}:
{A}: Okaaay-
{C}: Alright, um, I'm gonna go. I've embarrassed myself...
{A}: Maybe fire? Fire type?
{C}: Yeah fire-based? Like- have fires?{B}: Yeah, yeah I'll probably just- That's a good idea {A} I'll probably just do a fire type one... SO THAT <i>ONE</i> KID WITH <i>ONE</i> BLASTOISE CAN FUCK UP MY WHOLE SHOP.
{B}: KILLED ALL OF US WITH ONE BLASTOISE, HUH? WOW. SHIT I SHOULD'VE-
{C}: Just do rock, then! Just do rock type!
{B}, voice dripping with contempt: <i><b>The same Blastoise...</i></b>
