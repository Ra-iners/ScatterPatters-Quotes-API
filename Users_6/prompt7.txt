*Everyone is standing around the broken coffee maker* 
{A}: So. Who broke it? I'm not mad, I just wanna know. 
Everyone: 
{B}: ...I did. I broke it. 
{A}: No. No you didn't. {C}? 
{C}: Don't look at me. Look at {D}. 
{D}: What?! I didn't break it. 
{C}: Huh, that's weird. How'd you even know it was broken? 
{D}: Because it's sitting right in front of us and it's broken. 
{C}: Suspicious. 
{D}: No, it's not! 
{E}: If it matters, probably not, but {F} was the last one to use it. 
{F}: Liar! I don't even drink that crap! 
{E}: Oh really? Then what were you doing by the coffee cart earlier? 
{F}: I use the wooden stirrers to push back my cuticles. Everyone knows that, {E}! 
{B}: Okay let's not fight. I broke it. Let me pay for it, {A}. 
{A}: No! Who broke it!? 
Everyone: 
{E}: {A}... {C}'s been awfully quiet. 
{C}: rEALLY?! 
*Everyone starts arguing* 
{A}, being interviewed: I broke it. I burned my hand so I punched it. 
{A}: I predict 10 minutes from now they'll be at each other's throats with warpaint on their faces and a pig head on a stick. 
{A}: 
{A}: Good. It was getting a little chummy around here.
